# opendirectories

... is a repository with scripts and some hacked together JS code to search and use open directories.

# scripts

Just a wrapper for `wget`. It does what it needs to do.

# Chrome extension

I made a Chrome extension that lets you search. Nothing fancy, but it does the trick.

It has a feature to keep a list of blacklisted URLs you want to omit from your search results. 
You can also define your query types.
It uses Chrome's sycned storage so it's sweet.

# Firefox add-on

Same thing but for Firefox.

Doesn't have the blacklist or query types feature yet.
